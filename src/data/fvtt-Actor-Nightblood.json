You’ve tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this thing is that haunts you can’t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity.

You’ve tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this thing is that haunts you can’t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.</p>\r\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-X\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Choose&nbsp;two of Arcana, Investigation, Religion, or Survival</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-X\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Languages:</span></strong> Choose two, one of which is exotic.

It includes a chest, a crowbar, a hammer, three wooden stakes, a holy symbol, a flask of holy water, a set of manacles, a steel mirror, a flask of oil, a tinderbox, and&nbsp;3 torches.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Feature: Heart of Darkness</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness.

You’ve tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this thing is that haunts you can’t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.</p>\r\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-X\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Choose&nbsp;two of Arcana, Investigation, Religion, or Survival</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-X\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Languages:</span></strong> Choose two, one of which is exotic.

If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>\r\n<p>Placing a <strong>bag of holding</strong> inside an extradimensional space created by a <strong>handy haversack</strong>, <strong>portable hole</strong>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>",

          "value": "Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\n\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons—that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\n\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\n\nNothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\n\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.<p><blockquote>green purple orange fusia</blockquote></p>",
